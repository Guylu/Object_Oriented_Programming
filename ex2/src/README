=============================
i decided to split the different SpaceShips into their own subclasses with inheritance.
each spaceship has its own overrides and work independently of each other.
each spaceship acts differently and so they all have their own "doAction" methods.
the fact that i built my code in the way means that the code is very easy to change -
since every thing is independent of each other, i can make changes without worrying that i will
accidentally cause a "bug" in another part of the program.
also the program in very modular because each spaceship interacts with the API by their own.
(i hope) it is written in an Intuitively and understandably manner.

=  Implementation details   =
=============================
i decided to leave the "doAction" method in the SpaceShip class, and to write there code that is
in common to all the spaceship such as turning to shield off, lowering cooldown time etc..
in addition i decided to send the enemy picture by default in the getImage method, and only overrode
it once, in the human spaceship, because its the only one that is different.

=    Answers to questions   =
=============================

1. drunkardship design - i chose to implement this part using the "java.util.Random" library.
each option the spaceship can do(move teleport etc..) is decided randomly.
i generate a random number rnd1 between 0 and 6,that handles turning. half the time it will go
to the right and half thr time to the left.
i generate another random number rnd2 between 0 and 1, and if rnd1>rnd2, it will accelerate.
it will do similar random tests to then try and shoot, put shields up, and teleport..

all the number were chosen by trial and error, seeing what will generate the most random and weird
behavior that will use all the action the spaceship can do.

2. special spaceship -  i call this "THE GREEZLY BREAR!"
this ship is controlled by a scary greezly bear, witch does not want to be disturbed.
this bear will not actively try to attack you, unless you provoke it - enter its danger radius.
IF you provoke it, he will chase you out of its danger radius, by shooting you.
if however the bear is damaged enough, it will try to teleport out of any battle.
